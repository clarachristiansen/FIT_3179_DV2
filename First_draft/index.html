    <h1>Understanding Global Warming: Causes, Consequences, and Solutions</h1>
  </div>

  <div class="intro_text">
    <p>Climate change is a critical global issue caused by the significant increase in greenhouse gas emissions, especially carbon dioxide (CO2), in the past century. Human activities like fossil fuel burning, deforestation, industry, and agriculture release massive amounts of CO2 and other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. These gases trap heat, resulting in a "greenhouse effect" and a gradual rise in Earth's average temperature. This disrupts natural climate patterns, leading to more severe weather events, rising sea levels, ecosystem changes, and food and water security threats. Addressing climate change requires collective efforts like cleaner energy, sustainable land use, and conservation. Throughout this page you will gain insights about the causes, consequences and solutions associated with climate change.</p>

        <p>
          Global warming is primarily driven by the increased emission of greenhouse gases, with carbon dioxide (CO2) playing a central role. Emissions varies significantly among countries due to differences in population, industrialization, and energy sources. Generally, highly industrialized countries tend to have higher emissions per capita.
          To gain insights into this disparity, examine the map on the right to see the 2021 emissions per capita of each country. Evidently, some nations emit a larger quantity of gases than others, leading to more significant environmental impacts. Here, it is crucial to recognize that countries vary in terms of technological, social and economic advancement. With this in mind we should save space in the carbon budget to allow progress of the mentioned categories in the less developed countries.<br><br>Slider your curser across a country to explore its specific emissions.

        Displayed to the left is a graph illustrating the average monthly CO2 emissions spanning several decades. It is clear that CO2 emissions have consistently increased both within individual decades and overall. This year marks the pinnacle of CO2 emissions, reaching an all-time high. Without a significant reduction in CO2 emissions, we are heading towards catastrophic and inescapable consequences. <br><br>Please keep in mind that the seasonal fluctuations, characterized by small peaks and valleys, are influenced by Northern Hemisphere summer vegetation growth, which reduces atmospheric carbon dioxide, and winter decay, which elevates it.

To the left, you can slide the timeline from 1800 to 2015 to observe the steady increase in average temperatures over the recent years. On the right, a graph illustrates the alarming decline in sea ice over time. Notably, "old ice" has been rapidly melting, emphasizing the urgency of addressing climate change.</p>

    <p>Climate change can have indirect consequences, including an increased risk of earthquakes in some regions. While climate change itself does not directly cause earthquakes, it can contribute to conditions that elevate seismic activity. One significant factor is the melting of glaciers and ice sheets due to rising temperatures. As these massive ice masses shrink, they reduce the weight pressing down on the Earth's crust. This removal of weight can induce isostatic rebound, a process where the crust begins to rise, leading to an increased risk of seismic events. Below is a map showing the earthquakes of the last 20 years. Note that the earthquakes often occur along the boundaries of the tectonic plates.</p>
